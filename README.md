To complete this project we went through four main phases:
1. Data Exploration (EDA)
2. Data Preparation
3. Modeling
4. Prediction Engine



 Models Used
- Random Forest (tuned with GridSearchCV)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Final model deployed: Best Random Forest model from GridSearchCV


 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score


---



Key Insights
- Glucose and BMI are strong predictors of diabetes.  
- Random Forest performed best after hyperparameter tuning.  
- The prediction engine can generalize to unseen patient data.
